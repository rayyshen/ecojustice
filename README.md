# ðŸŒ± EcoJustice

EcoJustice leverages data from the CDC, EPA, and Census Bureau, combining it all into one easily digestable map. Features include a Social Vulnerability Index calculated using 16 data points from the CDC, demographic data on minority majority counties from the Census Bureau, and existing/proposed polluting facilities around the United States. With this tool, users can view proposed legislative and zoning bills that would pollute their communities, taking action using our toolbox which includes an AI Letter generator for direct communication with local representatives.
